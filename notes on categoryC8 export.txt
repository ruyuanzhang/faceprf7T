notes:
- the experiment is "66"
- the name is "categoryC8"
- 7 faces and then 1 gap.  500 ms.   4-s trial
- was designed for [1280x800 60Hz], on boldscreen in 7TAS. diameter of a stimulus should be 309 pixels
â€¢ think about stimulus size... might need to change!!
  - probably best to try to match what we did in the paper
- eyetracking would be nice if it doesn't take too long to get going

% C8:
% 5 pos x 5 pos x (3 tasks) = 75 stimuli [medium size faces; no more fixation grid; digit stream, dot task]
% 75 stimuli, 25 per run. 1 run type but 4 random physical instantiations. repeated for 3 tasks, 12 runs per session
% 756 px x 756 px resolution (as inherited from C5)
% bank of 7view*95id = 665 faces, special ptviewmovie hack to modulate across locations
% very special face ordering on each trial.
% each of the 25 is presented twice in a run.
% tasks: A - dot, B - rsvp, C - face task
% sameness: the same dots, the same stimulus frames, the same digits!
% approach: pre-run 4 times to get 4 physical instantiations.  and then set up the 12 runs.
% then, physical: 123 412 341 234
%           task: ABC ABC ABC ABC
% so, bootgroups goes like [1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3].
% on average, dot and face targets are 12.5 times / (30*4) = 0.104166 times per second
% on average, roughly, digit repeat is (1/9.6)/2 times per digit frame means 1/9.6 times per second
% NOTE: black and white digits are sometimes not visible (since dark hair). hm.
% NOTE: face identity task is really hard (too hard?) in the periphery
% NOTE: i thought the digit task was intensely hard.
